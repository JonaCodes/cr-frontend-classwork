/**
 * Simple components exercise.
 * Create a KpiHeader, KpiValue and KpiTagline components, one per file.
 
 * In the value component, make sure the value itself is stored in a `const`:
 * const value = 1000;
 * and then render this value in the component.
 
 * In the tagline component, store the percent change as a const as well
 * Also, color the tagline green or red depending on the sign of the change.
 * 
 * Note the css classes in `ex1.css` to help you build it "prettily"
