### Task: create tabs that conditionally render each of the exercise contents

- Use `useState` to track the active tab (start with a default of `1`)
- Create a button for each tab
- When a button is clicked, update the state by using the `set...` function
- Only render the content of the active tab

- Note the css classes in `App.css` to help you build the tabs prettily
